Description: Compares different versions of firmware images for upgradeability
 This tools allows you to identify how many flash pages/blocks match across
 different versions of a firmware image. This corresponds to the minimum number
 of flash pages/blocks that would need to be modified during a update between
 these firmware versions, assuming an ideal updater.
 .
 The idea is that this tool helps you model the expected speedup if your firmware
 updater was optimized to check for changes in each flash page before rewriting
 it. Often many pages in a firmware image don't change between versions.
 .
 The name comes from "comparing and contrasting flash" pages.
 .
