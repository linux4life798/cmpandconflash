Description: Compares different versions of firmware images for upgradeability
 This tool allows you to **compare and contrast** multiple flash
 firmware image binaries with respect to different flash page sizes.
 The idea is to be able to identify how many block are common
 between firmware binaries to understand how fast an optimized update may take.
